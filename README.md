# Content Moderation Workflow Optimizer

## Overview
The Content Moderation Workflow Optimizer simulates and operationalizes a scalable content review pipeline that mimics real-world content moderation environments. It was designed to optimize cost-to-serve, reduce SLA violations, and improve moderator efficiency using graph-based routing, distributed data pipelines, and data warehousing techniques.

This solution is ideal for data engineering roles requiring large-scale ETL, real-time data processing, and stakeholder collaboration. The project is built using Python, NetworkX, Redshift, Airflow, and AWS services and adheres to data governance, documentation, and monitoring standards.

## Key Business Problem
Moderating content efficiently is critical for platforms managing user-generated content. The primary challenges are:
- Assigning flagged content to the most appropriate and cost-effective moderators.
- Ensuring review efficiency while maintaining SLA targets.
- Scaling the moderation pipeline to handle high-volume content spikes without sacrificing performance.

---

## Technical Goals
- Simulate routing of 1000+ daily flagged contents across virtual moderator teams.
- Build data pipelines to ingest simulation logs, transform them, and store in Redshift.
- Model cost-efficiency and SLA metrics for each moderator group.
- Visualize review performance, cost metrics, and routing efficiency via BI tools.

---

## System Architecture

1. **Simulation Engine** (`routing_simulator.py`)
   - Constructs a directed graph of moderators with capacities and cost weights.
   - Dynamically assigns content based on available capacity and lowest routing cost.
   - Stores result in `routing_results.json`.

2. **ETL Pipeline** (`etl_pipeline.py`)
   - Reads simulation output and loads structured data into Redshift.
   - Applies transformation, validation, and data typing.

3. **Warehouse Schema** (`schema.sql`)
   - Defines DDL for storing performance metrics, assignment logs, and metadata.
   - Ensures data governance and auditability.

4. **Visualization Layer** (`dashboard_description.md`)
   - Suggests layout and KPIs for dashboards built in Tableau or Power BI.
   - Enables monitoring of cost, SLA, throughput, and moderator utilization.

## Stakeholder Impact

- **Product Managers**: Gain insight into content routing costs and moderator allocation patterns.
- **Data Scientists/ML Engineers**: Simulate review strategies and apply predictive modeling to optimize routing.
- **Engineering Teams**: Monitor pipeline efficiency and SLA metrics; continuously improve throughput.

## Data Governance & Quality
- Data quality checks include content duplication detection, schema validation, and type enforcement.
- Monitoring jobs implemented via Airflow alerts and CloudWatch for failure tracing and SLA alerts.
